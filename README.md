# Description:

Our Human face is having a mixed moods so we are to demonstrate the probabilities of these moods that we have.

## What does Mood Recognition mean?

Mood recognition is a technique used in software that allows a program to "read" the emotions on a human face using advanced image processing. Companies have been experimenting with combining sophisticated algorithms with image processing techniques that have emerged in the past ten years to understand more about what an image or a video of a person's face tells us about how he/she is feeling and not just that but also showing the probabilities of mixed emotions a face could has.

# Installations:

Install dependencies using requirements.txt

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage:

The program will creat a window to display the scene capture by webcamera and a window representing the probabilities of detected emotions.

> Demo

python real_time_video.py

It is a pre trained model, the model has been trained to 1000 Epochs.
